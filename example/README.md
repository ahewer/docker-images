# Using the main docker image with the example MRI data 

After you assembled the docker images, run the command
```sh
sh ./setup.sh
```
to download the example MRI data and the associated configuration files.

Afterwards, executing
```sh
sh ./run.sh
```
will provide access to an interactive docker container where you can work with the example data.
